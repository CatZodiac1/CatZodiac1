- 👋 Hi, I’m @CatZodiac1 otherwise known as Alix Matthews by my friends or David Jackson-Matthews in a professional environment.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis, Data Driven Storytelling and developing newer coding practices that make coding easier to understand and even more accesible to people as we'll need more people in the future who know how to code in order to sustain a more futuristic world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for Data Analytics from IBM's Coursera certification track. https://www.coursera.org/user/3e91460fd22aac7223dd331c6555d06f <-This is my Coursera profile. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help develop my coding skills. I am really enjoying coding and wouldn't mind helping others develop something as I learn.
